# Vision Task

## Objective

This task is designed to test your computer vision basics and understanding, and your adaptability to different interfaces.

## YOLOv8 Training

Train a YOLOv8 model on the given dataset, obtain the output metrics, and analyze them. Share the Colab file link with appropriate code and comments. Ensure that file access is granted when sharing.

> *You may use Roboflow for training the model.*

**Dataset**: [Aquarium Data COTS on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/slavkoprytula/aquarium-data-cots)

ðŸ’¡ *Convert your dataset to a suitable format before training.*

### **Answer these questions within the comments of your Colab file:**

1. Are you adding any augmentations to the dataset? If yes, which ones and why? If not, why not?
2. How many epochs are you using for this dataset training?
3. List any other hyperparameters specified during training. Provide reasoning for each.
4. What output metrics are you analyzing? Share concrete results from these.

ðŸ’¡ *You can use [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site/) for evaluation and analysis.*
